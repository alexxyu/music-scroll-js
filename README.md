# MusicScroll

This is a web app that allows you to navigate pages of a PDF using only facial gestures. This is
particularly helpful if you're a musician and want to go to the next page of your sheet music
without having to stop playing!

## How to Use

* Go to https://music-scroll.fly.dev/.
* Upload a PDF file of your sheet music. You'll have to allow camera access to the app.
* Start playing! Tilt your head up to flip to the next page. Tilt your head down to flip to the
previous page.

## To-Do / Possible Featuresi

These are some of the features that I had planned. I'm not sure when (or if) I'll get around to
working on these.

* Option to use URL to PDF file
* Faster PDF rendering
* Mobile compatibility
* Custom gestures
